# Engineering Standards

Reference materials for engineering decisions and standards.

## Available Standards

- [API Design Guidelines](./api-design-guidelines.md) - REST API conventions and best practices

## Purpose

These standards are snapshotted into each project folder at creation time. This ensures that projects are evaluated against the standards that were in effect when they were created, not against evolving standards.

## Usage

When creating a new project:

1. Copy the entire `_reference/` folder from `engineering/` to your project folder
2. Reference these standards in your ADRs and SDPs
3. Document any deviations with rationale
