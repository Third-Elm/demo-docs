# Brand Voice Guidelines

This document defines how we communicate across all marketing channels.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clear Over Clever

We prioritize clarity over wordplay. If a reader has to re-read a sentence, we've failed.

**Bad**: "Unlock the power of synergistic productivity paradigms"
**Good**: "Get more done in less time"

### 2. Confident, Not Arrogant

We know our product works. We don't need to shout.

**Bad**: "The ONLY solution you'll EVER need"
**Good**: "Built for teams who need reliable results"

### 3. Human, Not Corporate

Write like you're explaining to a smart colleague, not a boardroom.

**Bad**: "Leverage our enterprise-grade solution"
**Good**: "Use our tools designed for growing teams"

## Voice by Channel
