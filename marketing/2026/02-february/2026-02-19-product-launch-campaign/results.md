## Hypothesis Validation

### Original Hypothesis

> Technical case studies (showing real problem-solving with code) will generate higher signup conversion than feature-focused content (listing what the product does).

### Verdict

**VALIDATED** - Case studies performed significantly better across all metrics.

### Evidence

1. **Conversion rate**: Case study (10%) vs Feature list (3%) = 3.3x improvement
2. **CTR**: Case study (7%) vs Feature list (3.3%) = 2.1x improvement
3. **Engagement**: Case study tweets averaged 45 retweets vs 12 for feature posts
4. **Qualitative**: Comments on case studies were more engaged ("This is exactly our problem")

---

## Learnings

### What Worked

- **Code examples**: Tweets with actual code snippets had highest engagement
- **Problem-first framing**: Starting with "Here's a problem we solved" performed better than "Here's our new feature"
- **Twitter thread format**: Multi-tweet stories kept attention longer than single tweets
- **LinkedIn case study**: Manager-focused angle ("How we saved 10 hours/week") resonated

### What Didn't Work

- **Feature comparison charts**: Low engagement, felt too promotional
- **Generic "now available" posts**: Got lost in feed noise
- **Same-day posting across channels**: Should stagger for timezone optimization

### Surprises

- Email list converted at 6.7x rate of paid channels (but limited volume)
- Hacker News post got no traction - likely too promotional
- Wednesday posts outperformed Monday by 40%

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Double down on case studies**: Reallocate remaining Q1 budget to case study format
2. **Create more code examples**: Developers engage with technical depth
3. **Stagger posting times**: Optimize for each channel's peak hours

### Future Campaigns

1. **Start with case study format**: Make it default approach for developer products
2. **Build email list earlier**: Highest ROI channel, needs more volume
3. **Skip Hacker News for launches**: Better for organic discussion than announcements
4. **Test day-of-week effects**: Wednesday advantage worth investigating
