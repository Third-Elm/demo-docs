# Campaign Brief: Product Launch Campaign

**Date**: 2026-02-12
**Campaign Dates**: 2026-02-15 to 2026-02-28
**Status**: Active
**Author**: Marketing Team

---

## Objective

Generate awareness and signups for the new Task API product launch. Target 500 new signups within the two-week campaign period.

## Target Audience

Who are we reaching with this campaign?

- **Demographics**: Software developers, engineering managers, 25-45 years old
- **Geography**: North America, Europe
- **Psychographics**: Value productivity, prefer simple solutions, early adopters
- **Pain Points**: Wasted time on repetitive tasks, disorganized workflows, tool fragmentation

## Hypothesis

Developers respond better to technical case studies than feature lists. We believe showing how the Task API solved a real problem will convert better than explaining what features it has.

## Plan

### Channels

- Twitter/X - Technical thread with code examples
- LinkedIn - Case study posts targeting engineering managers
- Developer communities (Hacker News, Reddit) - Organic discussion
- Email - Launch announcement to existing waitlist

### Budget

| Channel   | Allocation | Amount |
| --------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Twitter/X | 40%        | $4,000 |
| LinkedIn  | 30%        | $3,000 |
| Email     | 10%        | $1,000 |
| Reserve   | 20%        | $2,000 |

**Total**: $10,000

- Video content (production timeline too long)
- PR outreach (separate initiative)
